nvim-cokeline

A Neovim bufferline for people with addictive personalities

The goal of this plugin is not to be an opinionated bufferline with (more or
less) limited customization options. Rather, it tries to provide a general
framework allowing you to build **your** ideal bufferline, whatever that might
look like.


FEATURES                                                   *cokeline-features*


ENDLESSLY CUSTOMIZABLE ~

`nvim-cokeline` aims to be the most customizable bufferline plugin around. If
you have an idea in mind of what your bufferline should look like, you should
be able to make it look that way. If you can’t, open an issue and we’ll try
to make it happen!


DYNAMIC RENDERING ~

Even when you have a lot of buffers open, `nvim-cokeline` is rendered to always
keep the focused buffer visible and in the middle of the bufferline. Also, if a
buffer doesn’t fit entirely we still try to include as much of it as possible
before cutting off the rest.


LSP SUPPORT ~

If a buffer has an LSP client attached to it, you can configure the style of a
component to change based on how many errors, warnings, infos and hints are
reported by the LSP.


BUFFER PICK ~

You can focus and close any buffer by typing its `pick_letter`. Letters are
assigned by filename by default (e.g. `foo.txt` gets the letter `f`), and by
keyboard reachability if the letter is already assigned to another buffer.


SIDEBARS ~

You can add a left sidebar to integrate nicely with file explorer plugins like
nvim-tree.lua <https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua>, CHADTree
<https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree> or NERDTree
<https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree>.


UNIQUE BUFFER NAMES ~

When files with the same filename belonging to different directories are opened
simultaneously, you can include a unique filetree prefix to distinguish between
them:


CLICKABLE BUFFERS ~

Left click on a buffer to focus it, and right click to delete it.
Alternatively, define custom click handlers for each component that override
the default behavior.


HOVER EVENTS ~

Each component has access to an is_hovered property, and can be given custom
`on_mouse_enter` and `on_mouse_leave` handlers, allowing for implementations of
close buttons, diagnostic previews, and more complex funcionality.


BUFFER RE-ORDERING (INCLUDING MOUSE-DRAG REORDERING) ~


CLOSE ICONS ~


BUFFER HISTORY TRACKING ~

>lua
    require("cokeline.history"):last():focus()
<

If you are a user of `resession.nvim`
<https://github.com/stevearc/resession.nvim>, cokeline’s history will be
restored along with the rest of your sessions.


PLANS AND IDEAS                                     *cokeline-plans-and-ideas*

If you have an idea or feature request, don’t hesitate to open an issue!


REQUIREMENTS                                           *cokeline-requirements*

The two main requirements are Neovim 0.5+ and the `termguicolors` option to be
set. If you want to display devicons in your bufferline you’ll also need the
kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons <https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons>
plugin and a patched font (see Nerd Fonts <https://www.nerdfonts.com/>).

As of v0.4.0, nvim-lua/plenary.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim>
is required as well.

  **note** Check out the wiki <https://github.com/willothy/nvim-cokeline/wiki>

All the configuration is done by changing the contents of the Lua table passed

SO WHAT’S FUNCTION(BUFFER)? ~

Some of the configuration options can be functions that take a `Buffer`
<https://github.com/willothy/nvim-cokeline/wiki/Buffer> as a single parameter.
This is useful as it allows users to set the values of components dynamically
based on the buffer that component is being rendered for.

The `Buffer` type is just a Lua table with the following keys:

>lua
    Buffer = {
      -- The buffer's order in the bufferline (1 for the first buffer, 2 for the
      -- second one, etc.).
      index = int,
    
      -- The buffer's internal number as reported by `:ls`.
      number = int,
    
      ---@type boolean
      is_focused = false,
    
      ---@type boolean
      is_modified = false,
    
      ---@type boolean
      is_readonly = false,
    
      -- The buffer is the first visible buffer in the tab bar
      ---@type boolean
      is_first    = false,
    
      -- The buffer is the last visible buffer in the tab bar
      ---@type boolean
      is_last     = false,
    
      -- The mouse is hovering over the current component in the buffer
      -- This is a special variable in that it will only be true for the hovered *component*
      -- on render. This is to allow components to respond to hover events individually without managing
      -- component state.
      ---@type boolean
      is_hovered  = false,
    
      -- The mouse is hovering over the buffer (true for all components)
      ---@type boolean
      buf_hovered = false,
    
      -- The buffer's type as reported by `:echo &buftype`.
      ---@type string
      ---@type string
      type = '',
    
      -- The buffer's filetype as reported by `:echo &filetype`.
      ---@type string
      filetype = '',
    
      -- The buffer's full path.
      ---@type string
      path = '',
    
      -- The buffer's filename.
      ---@type string
      filename = 'string',
    
      -- A unique prefix used to distinguish buffers with the same filename
      -- stored in different directories. For example, if we have two files
      -- `bar/foo.md` and `baz/foo.md`, then the first will have `bar/` as its
      -- unique prefix and the second one will have `baz/`.
      ---@type string
      unique_prefix = '',
    
      -- The letter that is displayed when picking a buffer to either focus or
      -- close it.
      ---@type string
      pick_letter = 'char',
    
      -- This needs the `kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons` plugin to be installed.
      devicon = {
        -- An icon representing the buffer's filetype.
        ---@type string
        icon = 'string',
    
        -- The colors of the devicon in hexadecimal format (useful to be passed
        -- to a component's `fg` field (see the `Components` section).
        color = '#rrggbb',
      },
    
      -- The values in this table are the ones reported by Neovim's built in
      -- LSP interface.
      diagnostics = {
        ---@type integer
        errors = 0,
        ---@type integer
        warnings = 0,
        ---@type integer
        infos = 0,
        ---@type integer
        hints = 0,
      },
    }
<

It also has methods that can be used in component event handlers:

>lua
    ---@param self Buffer
    ---Deletes the buffer
    function Buffer:delete() end
    
    ---@param self Buffer
    ---Focuses the buffer
    function Buffer:focus() end
    
    ---@param self Buffer
    ---@return number
    ---Returns the number of lines in the buffer
    function Buffer:lines() end
    
    ---@param self Buffer
    ---@return string[]
    ---Returns the buffer's lines
    function Buffer:text() end
    
    ---@param buf Buffer
    ---@return boolean
    ---Returns true if the buffer is valid
    function Buffer:is_valid() end
<


WHAT ABOUT TABPAGES? ~

Each method on a tab component is passed a `TabPage` object as an argument.

`TabPage`, like `Buffer`, is simply a Lua table with some relevant data
attached.

>lua
    TabPage = {
      -- The tabpage number, as reported by `nvim_list_tabpages`
      ---@type integer
      number = 0,
      -- A list of Window objects contained in the TabPage (see wiki for more info)
      ---@type Window[]
      windows = {},
      -- The currently focused window in the TabPage
      ---@type Window
      focused = nil,
      -- True if the TabPage is the current TabPage
      ---@type boolean
      is_active = true,
      -- True if the TabPage is first in the list
      ---@type boolean
      is_first = false,
      -- True if the TabPage is last in the list
      ---@type boolean
      is_last = false
    }
<


AND COMPONENTS? ~

You can configure what each buffer in your bufferline will be composed of by
passing a list of components to the `setup` function.

For example, let’s imagine we want to construct a very minimal bufferline
where the only things we’re displaying for each buffer are its index, its
filename and a close button.

Then in our `setup` function we’d have:

>lua
    require('cokeline').setup({
      -- ...
      components = {
        {
          text = function(buffer) return ' ' .. buffer.index end,
        },
        {
          text = function(buffer) return ' ' .. buffer.filename .. ' ' end,
        },
        {
          text = '󰅖',
          on_click = function(buffer)
            buffer:delete()
          end
        },
        {
          text = ' ',
        }
      }
    })
<

in this case every buffer would be composed of four components: the first
displaying a space followed by the buffer index, the second one the filename
padded by a space on each side, then a close button that allows us to
`:bdelete` the buffer by left-clicking on it, and finally an extra space.

This way of dividing each buffer into distinct components, combined with the
ability to define every component’s text and color depending on some property
of the buffer we’re rendering, allows for great customizability.

Every component passed to the `components` list has to be a table of the form:

>lua
    {
    
      ---@type string | fun(buffer: Buffer): string
      text = "",
    
      -- The foreground, backgrond and style of the component
      ---@type nil | string | fun(buffer: Buffer): string
      fg = '#rrggbb',
      ---@type nil | string | fun(buffer: Buffer): string
      bg = '#rrggbb',
      ---@type nil | string | fun(buffer: Buffer): string
      sp = '#rrggbb',
      ---@type nil | boolean | fun(buffer: Buffer): boolean
      bold = false,
      ---@type nil | boolean | fun(buffer: Buffer): boolean
      italic = false,
      ---@type nil | boolean | fun(buffer: Buffer): boolean
      underline = false,
      ---@type nil | boolean | fun(buffer: Buffer): boolean
      undercurl = false,
      ---@type nil | boolean | fun(buffer: Buffer): boolean
      strikethrough = false,
    
      -- Or, alternatively, the name of the highlight group
      ---@type nil | string | fun(buffer: Buffer): string
      highlight = nil,
    
      -- If `true` the buffer will be deleted when this component is
      -- left-clicked (usually used to implement close buttons, overrides `on_click`).
      -- deprecated, it is recommended to use the Buffer:delete() method in an on_click event
      -- to implement close buttons instead.
      ---@type boolean
      delete_buffer_on_left_click = false,
    
      -- Handles click event for a component
      -- If not set, component will have the default click behavior
      -- buffer is a Buffer object, not a bufnr
      ---@type nil | fun(idx: integer, clicks: integer, button: string, mods: string, buffer: Buffer)
      on_click = nil,
    
      -- Called on a component when hovered
      ---@type nil | function(buffer: Buffer, mouse_col: integer)
      on_mouse_enter = nil,
    
      -- Called on a component when unhovered
      ---@type nil | function(buffer: Buffer, mouse_col: integer)
      on_mouse_leave = nil,
    
      truncation = {
        -- default: index of the component in the `components` table (1 for the
        -- first component, 2 for the second, etc.).
        ---@type integer
        priority = 1,
    
        -- default: `right`.
        ---@type 'left' | 'middle' | 'right'
        direction = 'left' | 'middle' | 'right',
      },
    }

the `text` key is the only one that has to be set, all the others are optional
and can be omitted.

The `truncation` table controls what happens when a buffer is too long to be
displayed in its entirety.

More specifically, if a buffer’s width (given by the sum of the widths of all
its components) is bigger than the `rendering.max_buffer_width` config option,
the buffer will be truncated.

The default behaviour is truncate the buffer by dropping components from right
to left, with the text of the last component that’s included also being
shortened from right to left. This can be modified by changing the values of
the `truncation.priority` and `truncation.direction` keys.

The `truncation.priority` controls the order in which components are dropped:
the first component to be dropped will be the one with the lowest priority. If
that’s still not enough to bring the width of the buffer within the
`rendering.max_buffer_width` limit, the component with the second lowest
priority will be dropped, and so on. Note that a higher priority means a
smaller integer value: a component with a priority of 5 will be dropped _after_
a component with a priority of 6, even though 6 > 5.

The `truncation.direction` key simply controls from which direction a component
is shortened. For example, you might want to set the `truncation.direction` of
a component displaying a filename to `'middle'` or `'left'`, so that if the
filename has to be shortened you’ll still be able to see its extension, like
in the following example (where it’s set to `'left'`):


WHAT ABOUT HISTORY?

The History keeps track of the buffers you access using a ringbuffer, and
provides an API for accessing Buffer objects from the history.

You can access the history using `require("cokeline.history")`, or through the
global `_G.cokeline.history`.

The `History` object provides these methods:

>lua
    History = {}
    
    ---Adds a Buffer object to the history
    ---@type bufnr integer
    function History:push(bufnr)
    end
    
    ---Removes and returns the oldest Buffer object in the history
    ---@return Buffer?
    function History:pop()
    end
    
    ---Returns a list of Buffer objects in the history,
    ---ordered from oldest to newest
    ---@return Buffer[]
    function History:list()
    end
    
    ---Returns an iterator of Buffer objects in the history,
    ---ordered from oldest to newest
    ---@return fun(): Buffer?
    function History:iter()
    end
    
    ---Get a Buffer object by history index
    ---@param idx integer
    ---@return Buffer?
    function History:get(idx)
    end
    
    ---Get a Buffer object representing the last-accessed buffer (before the current one)
    ---@return Buffer?
    function History:last()
    end
    
    ---Returns true if the history is empty
    ---@return boolean
    function History:is_empty()
    end
    
    ---Returns the maximum number of buffers that can be stored in the history
    ---@return integer
    function History:capacity()
    end
    
    ---Returns true if the history contains the given buffer
    ---@param bufnr integer
    ---@return boolean
    function History:contains(bufnr)
    end
    
    ---Returns the number of buffers in the history
    ---@return integer
    function History:len()
    end

MAPPINGS                                                   *cokeline-mappings*

You can use the `mappings` module to create mappings from Lua:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>bp", function()
        require('cokeline.mappings').pick("focus")
    end, { desc = "Pick a buffer to focus" })
<

Alternatively, we expose the following `<Plug>` mappings which can be used as
the right hand side of other mappings:

>
    -- Focus the previous/next buffer
    <Plug>(cokeline-focus-prev)
    <Plug>(cokeline-focus-next)
    
    -- Switch the position of the current buffer with the previous/next buffer.
    <Plug>(cokeline-switch-prev)
    <Plug>(cokeline-switch-next)
    
    -- Focuses the buffer with index `i`.
    <Plug>(cokeline-focus-i)
    
    -- Switches the position of the current buffer with the buffer of index `i`.
    <Plug>(cokeline-switch-i)
    
    -- Focus a buffer by its `pick_letter`.
    <Plug>(cokeline-pick-focus)
    
    -- Close a buffer by its `pick_letter`.
    <Plug>(cokeline-pick-close)
<

A possible configuration could be:

>lua
    local map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap
    
    map("n", "<S-Tab>", "<Plug>(cokeline-focus-prev)", { silent = true })
    map("n", "<Tab>", "<Plug>(cokeline-focus-next)", { silent = true })
    map("n", "<Leader>p", "<Plug>(cokeline-switch-prev)", { silent = true })
    map("n", "<Leader>n", "<Plug>(cokeline-switch-next)", { silent = true })
    
    for i = 1, 9 do
      map(
        "n",
        ("<F%s>"):format(i),
        ("<Plug>(cokeline-focus-%s)"):format(i),
        { silent = true }
      )
      map(
        "n",
        ("<Leader>%s"):format(i),
        ("<Plug>(cokeline-switch-%s)"):format(i),
        { silent = true }
      )
    end
